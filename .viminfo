<Everywhere, numbers are increasingly in variation, and display increasingly distributional characteristics.  While some events have discrete outcomes (Obama was re-elected in 2012), many happenings are not. In Lancaster here in north-west England, the probability of rain on a given day would be say 70%, but days have very different amounts of rain.  Some days, it rains once briefly and lightly. Other days it rains frequently and heavily. A gamut of rain events can occur, and each would distribute different amounts of water on Lancaster. Given the amount of variation,  a much better way to face the weather is to say that Lancaster's rain is a *random variable*: ‚Äòa random variable is a mapping that assigns a real number to each outcome‚Äô [@wasserman_all_2003,19]. If events have probabilities, random variables have a range of outcomes that are mapped to numbers. Again, the deceptive simplicity of 'mapping' hides many variations. Mapping is a form of one-to-one correspondence, usually expressed as a mathematical function. A random variable links events to numbers through functions.  Again, all this remains rather formal. The practical reality of random variables is variation, variations that are  visually expressed by curves and by probability distributions.

<Probability distributions are a common way of showing and  talking about random variables. The curves shown in Figure 2 could refer to almost anything (the chances of rain at different times of day in Lancaster, the seasonal variation in precipitation, etc.). These distributions appear in countless shapes and forms in scientific, government and popular literature of many different kinds. Statistical graphics have a rich history and semiology that I do not discuss here (see [@bertin_semiology_1983]). Perhaps the most famous function or mapping is the normal or Gaussian distribution:
	
	>$f(x;\mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$
	
	1832
<This  function, whose mathematics were intensively worked over during the 18-19th centuries, has a power-laden biopolitical history closely tied with knowledges and governing of  national and other  populations. The key symbols here include $\mu$, the mean and $\sigma$, the variance. These two parameters together describe  the shape of the curve. Given $\mu$ and $\sigma$, it become possible to map different outcomes to probabilities. Given the normal distribution, it is possible, under certain circumstances, to effectively subjectify someone on the spot. For instance, if an educational psychologist indicates to someone that their intelligence lies towards the left-hand side of the normal curve peak in Figure 2 (and hence less than the population mean), they quickly render them somehow subject to the normal curve. But statistics uses dozens of different probability distributions to map continuous and discrete variations to real numbers. Other probability distributions abound ‚Äî normal (Gaussian), uniform, Cauchy exponential, gamma, beta,  hypergeometric, binomial, Poisson, chi-squared, Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions, etc (see [@nist_2012] for a gallery of distributions) ‚Äî because outcomes occur in widely differing patterns. The  queuing times at airport check-ins do not, for instance, easily fit a normal distribution. Queues are usually modelled using a Poisson distribution, which unfortunately for travellers, distributes waiting times very differently.  Similarly, it might be better to think of the probability of rain today in Lancaster in terms of a Poisson distribution that models that queue of clouds in the Atlantic just waiting to land on the northwest coast of England. Rather than addressing the question of if it will rain or not, a Poisson-based model might address the question of how soon.
	
	2016
<The diverse range of probability distributions ‚Äî and we will see below some reasons why we can expect them to proliferate in certain settings ‚Äî attests to the variety of ways in which events might be mapped to real numbers. Despite  the sometime forbidding mathematical equations, the term *distribution* emphasises a quite material or tangible way of thinking about how probabilities vary. The curves in both Figure 1 and Figure 2 are examples of the most common mathematical descriptions in any data analysis setting: they are  *probability density* functions (pdf). (There are also  *probability mass* functions for variables that have discrete values; for instance: 1,2,3,4,5). Pdfs such as the Gaussian function shown above are usually graphed as a curve that indicates how likely a random variable is to take on a particular value. In many cases, statistical practice seeks to estimate distribution functions such as pdfs (or their close relatives, cdfs ‚Äî *cumulative distribution functions*) for the given data. Statisticians speak of 'fitting a density' to data, emphasising their assumption that events can be incorporated in the forms of probability distributions. The underlying probability distribution is in principle ‚Äòunobservable‚Äô as such, but a probability density function is  assumed to give rise to all the variations in data gathered through experiments and observations. The task is to estimate the shape of that curve, and its defining parameters (means, variance, etc.). Given that curve, areas under the pdf equate to the likely range of value of a variable. While the total 'probability mass' under the probability density function curve always must be equal to one (since the combined probability of all possible outcomes = 1), finding the area under particular parts of the curve is a key issue. Finding the area under probability density curves becomes the way in which many epistemic processes envisage lived states of affairs as random variables or as numbers in variation.

<In order to make something of the transformation discussable, some definitional discussion might be useful. I'm suggesting that we countenace a scene in which multiple different probability practices stack on top of each other. Amidst these, random variables and their associated probability distributions particularly concern us. As we will see, the power of the transformation in probability associated with machine learning algorithms resides in their capacity to draw in many more relations, features and components of data in support of a probabilistic outcome.dwis, as best described by probability distributions. The ensuing popularity of Bayesian inference is a striking example of transverse momentum of methods across fields, and the chapter will trace some of the ramifications of the heavily-used MCMC technique in fields ranging from nuclear physics, image processing to political science and epidemiology.

<The topic in this chapter is the role of randomness and probability in machine learning. While statistical techniques and practices have been discussed in previous chapters, this chapter foregrounds the changes in probability practices associated with machine learning. I approach this mainly through the extremely simple and easily implemented Naive Bayes classifier but also with some reference to theso-called 'Bayesian revolution' in statistical practice that took shape in the early 1990s, and in particular, the key algorithmic technique used in Bayesian statistics, Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC). Across the gamut of differences between the very simple Naive Bayes approach and the sophisticated MCMC techniques, we can see a broad ranging shift in probability practice has been occurring. The key argument here, following on from the discussions of vector space, the function of optimisation and the development of decisionistic mechanisms developed in the preceding chapters is that what is happening to data, the ways in which are being corralled and marshalled, and the kinds of pattern-finding, anticipation or pre-emption delivered by machine learning need to be considered alongside a transformation in the status of probability. This is not the first such transformation, but it is the  The computationally intensive techniques of Bayesian analysis treat all numbers as potentially random variables; that is, as best described by probability distributions. The ensuing popularity of Bayesian inference is a striking example of transverse momentum of methods across fields, and the chapter will trace some of the ramifications of the heavily-used MCMC technique in fields ranging from nuclear physics, image processing to political science and epidemiology.
